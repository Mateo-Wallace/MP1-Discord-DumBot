# MP1-Discord-DumBot

This bot has become outdated. See [Discord DumBot V2](https://github.com/Mateo-Wallace/MP2-Discord-DumBot-V2) for the full release.

Discord DumBot is an extremely simple bot for discord. It works in multiple discord servers and is ready to be added to yours, and makes it so when a user types `/dumbot` the bot will respond with `Hello, I am DumBot. I am very dumb.`

While building this bot I learned how to:

- Add a bot to a discord server
- Track the chat for a specific command
- Have the bot respond with a message in chat
- Host the bot on a site called `Glitch`
